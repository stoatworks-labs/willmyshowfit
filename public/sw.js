// Service worker: offline use, without the risk of a permanently stale app.
//
// The whole point of installing this tool to a home screen is having it in a
// loading bay with no signal. That means caching. It also means the classic
// service-worker failure is now available to us: a cached shell that outlives
// every deploy, so the app silently never updates again and there is nothing
// the user can do about it short of clearing site data.
//
// The strategy below is chosen to make that failure impossible rather than
// unlikely:
//
//   navigations  -> network first, cache as fallback
//   /assets/*    -> cache first, because Vite content-hashes those filenames,
//                   so a given URL's bytes can never change
//   everything else -> network first, cache as fallback
//
// A navigation always asks the network first, so an online user is always on
// the current build; the cache only answers when the network does not. And
// because asset URLs change with their content, a new build fetches new URLs
// and cannot be served yesterday's JavaScript.
//
// Bump CACHE when the caching behaviour itself changes. It does not need
// bumping per deploy — the hashed filenames already handle that — and old
// caches are deleted on activate, so a bump costs one cold fetch.

const CACHE = 'wmsf-v2';

// Enough to boot offline. Everything else arrives through runtime caching.
const SHELL = [
  '/',
  '/manifest.webmanifest',
  '/icon.svg',
  '/support-footer.js',
];

// Pull in the hashed files the current build actually names.
//
// This is not belt and braces. A page's own scripts are fetched before this
// worker controls anything -- registration happens on `load`, by which time
// the browser has the bundle already -- so an install alone leaves the one
// file the app cannot start without uncached. The shell would open with no
// signal and render nothing, and "works offline" would quietly mean "from
// the second visit onwards".
//
// Reading the shell HTML back and caching whatever /assets/ URLs it names
// costs one extra fetch at activate and makes the first visit enough.
