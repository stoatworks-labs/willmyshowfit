// Service worker: offline use, without the risk of a permanently stale app.
//
// The whole point of installing this tool to a home screen is having it in a
// loading bay with no signal. That means caching. It also means the classic
// service-worker failure is now available to us: a cached shell that outlives
// every deploy, so the app silently never updates again and there is nothing
// the user can do about it short of clearing site data.
//
// The strategy below is chosen to make that failure impossible rather than
// unlikely:
//
//   navigations  -> network first, cache as fallback
//   /assets/*    -> cache first, because Vite content-hashes those filenames,
//                   so a given URL's bytes can never change
//   everything else -> straight to the network
//
// A navigation always asks the network first, so an online user is always on
// the current build; the cache only answers when the network does not. And
// because asset URLs change with their content, a new build fetches new URLs
// and cannot be served yesterday's JavaScript.
//
// Bump CACHE when the caching behaviour itself changes. It does not need
// bumping per deploy — the hashed filenames already handle that — and old
// caches are deleted on activate, so a bump costs one cold fetch.
